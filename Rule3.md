A rule may never contradict an existing rule. If any rules are found to be in conflict with one another, the rules must be updated, or all rules but the one with the lowest 
id are invalidated.

If a rule references another rule which is later invalidated, the existing rule must be 
revised to remove the mention, else it will be invalidated.
